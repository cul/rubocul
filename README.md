## Versioning & Dependencies

This project depends on `bixby`, which depends on `rubocop` and `rubocop-rspec`. `bixby` supports versions its dependent gems pessimistically. Therefore we also support version of `bixby` pessimistically. Once we get a release candidate we will match major version numbers with `bixby` major version numbers.
